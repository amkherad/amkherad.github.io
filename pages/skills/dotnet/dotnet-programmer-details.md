I'm developing applications using .NET for over 10 years now. The variety of applications I made with .NET are
from small tools to distributed systems. I developed WinForm applications, WPF and Xamarin applications, and most importantly web applications using dotnet.
It's my main platform so I love it.


The most important features of .NET that makes it special in my opinion are:
* Cross-platform, with dotnet becoming cross-platform it would eliminate any suspicion about it's survival for many decades.
* Runtime reflection, being able to obtain information about objects or manipulate objects at runtime can be very useful for
making many parts of system automatic.
* Delegation and closures are very useful in many aspects of programming, specially when you want to use best suited patterns in complex applications.
Many plaforms had suffer from lack of this feature in the past but most of them are supporting delegation in the latest releases,
but dotnet have had this feature from the very early life-cycle of the platform and it was essential for it's event system.
* Expression Trees (Linq), being able to generate runtime code with pseudo codes is amazing and will allow someone to generate
high performance code in run-time.
* It has the best of every world, almost every pattern and approach is doable in C# and dotnet platform.
* Great syntax, C# is a nice-looking language that is enjoyful to code with.


## What I've Made
* I use .NET for web API development, because I feel that it's the most suitable platform for developing APIs.
* I learned to develop interpreters and compilers in .NET, it accually has a lot of features that will help you in text processing, like
    enumerables and lazy functions, or the most recent feature of [spans and memories](http://web.archive.org/save/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/january/csharp-all-about-span-exploring-a-new-net-mainstay).
* I developed many custom protocols with dotnet. (e.g. yielded promise<!--[Yielded promise](/posts/yielded-response-in-web)-->)
* The most enjoying software I made with .NET is PlaqueStudio, I developed this amazing AI application when I was just over 18 in
    my first startup company that I started with my friends. It was a full-featured parking automation system that was running in kiosk mode,
    accually I customized windows 8 and removed the userinit process and replaced my own user interface layer to prevent any kind of unwanted access to the system.  
    * Every aspect of the system was modular, even the AI system was modular. (accually the core system was just an API for modules and a host window)
    * The AI had a high accuracy, and was able to detect the cars using multiple factors.
    * It was distributed, For instance you could have 2 monitoring systems and 10 gateway systems, and the processing could have been distributed among them.
    * I developed an advanced error reporting system so it was able to collect information from systems without internet to a single node
    with internet and send them to out server from that node.
    * Here are some screenshots:
