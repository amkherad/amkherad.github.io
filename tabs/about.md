title: About
---
Full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience in making small to big applications and systems.
I designed and implemented many softwares throughout these years including 20+ compilers,
10+ full-stack frameworks in different environments. I began writing code when I was around 14,
and the first piece of code I ever wrote was a very simple interpreter for C language in C!,
when I was learning C language I tried to implement the simple functions that the book
was introducing (like `strlen`), then it turned into trying to parse and execute arithmetic
expressions and very soon I was trying to "interpret" all the previous codes I've been writing,
I didn't know what I was doing back then, but now I know that the first code I wrote was an interpreter!
